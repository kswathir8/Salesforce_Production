    <description>Allowing for more advanced operations (i.e. merging fields from multiple records), use this Visualforce template to send an auto-response email informing the customer that a case has been opened. It instructs the customer to respond directly to the email to update the Case, but without the designated markers -- appearing less like a system-generated email. Includes merge fields for the auto-population of Case Number, Status, Priority Level, Subject, and Description.</description>
